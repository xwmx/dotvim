" ============================================================================

" Show (partial) command in the last line of the screen.  Set this
" option off if your terminal is slow.
" In Visual mode the size of the selected area is shown:
" - When selecting characters within a line, the number of characters.
"   If the number of bytes is different it is also displayed: '2-6'
"  means two characters and six bytes.
" - When selecting more than one line, the number of lines.
" - When selecting a block, the size in screen characters:
"   {lines}x{columns}.
"
" This option is also notably useful for displaying the timeout for the leader
" key.

" they are sourced and run from `bask`.

" code into ES5.

"
" Spacemacs is an Emacs advanced Kit focused on Evil, and .spacemacs is a
" configuration file for it.

" be added to the .ssh/config.d directory and subsequently compiled into one
" larger ssh configuration file.
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *.sshconfig set filetype=sshconfig

" ====
" Yaml
" ====

" Set .yaml and .yml as yaml files rather than eruby.yaml, which causes the
" eruby delimeters to be used by NERD Commenter. More information:

" SH / shell default syntax config
" ============================================================================

" g:is_posix
"
" Setting this variable prevents errors from being displayed in sh shell
" scripts. For example, without this setting, $() command substitution is
" displayed as an error, typically with a red background (specified by either
" the Error or ErrorMsg highlight group), because pre-POSIX
" shells only supported the backtick syntax (`..`) which is now discouraged.
" (see: https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2006). With this
" setting, however, the default is set to KornShell (ksh), which is
" POSIX-compliant and supports the $() syntax.
